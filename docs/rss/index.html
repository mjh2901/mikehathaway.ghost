It is under intensive development by the community. Rocky Linux is led by Gregory Kurtzer, founder of the CentOS project. Contributors are asked to reach out using the communication options offered on this site.&quot; &#xA0;</p><p>With RedHat ending CentOS in favor of limited free versions of the Red Hat Operating System, the CentOS community is looking for a stable binary compatable open source replacement. &#xA0;Enter Rocky Linux a downstream build of RHOS just as CentOS was. &#xA0;Rocky linux was founded by Gregory Kurtzer who was also a founder of CentOS.</p><p>Why should you use Rocky Linux? &#xA0;Anyone who needs a RHOS system, but will not be purchasing an expensive support contract. &#xA0;Rocky Linux is a good starter OS for a home lab, a company building infrastructure, cloud hosting etc... &#xA0;As a long time BSD user I have avoided CentOS but Rocky is definetely growing on me. &#xA0;The stabiliyt and long lifespan of Rocky Linux distributions can be easier for deploying software than other linux operating systems.</p><p><strong>How To: &#xA0;</strong>We are going to start with a Virtual machine on a proxmox server but you can use any computer including a Raspberry Pi. &#xA0;For my install I have a VM with access to 4 processors, 2 gigs of ram, and 64 gigs of hard drive space. &#xA0;This machine is fine for running a web server, docker or just about anything else.</p><p>Select Install Rocky Linux 8</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://mikehathaway.com/content/images/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-02-at-7.24.26-AM.png" class="kg-image" alt="Rocky Linux, Install" loading="lazy" width="1242" height="917" srcset="https://mikehathaway.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-02-at-7.24.26-AM.png 600w, https://mikehathaway.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-02-at-7.24.26-AM.png 1000w, https://mikehathaway.com/content/images/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-02-at-7.24.26-AM.png 1242w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Select your preferred language</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://mikehathaway.com/content/images/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-02-at-7.26.20-AM.png" class="kg-image" alt="Rocky Linux, Install" loading="lazy" width="1242" height="917" srcset="https://mikehathaway.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-02-at-7.26.20-AM.png 600w, https://mikehathaway.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-02-at-7.26.20-AM.png 1000w, https://mikehathaway.com/content/images/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-02-at-7.26.20-AM.png 1242w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>There are several sections that should be configured prior to OS install vs after. &#xA0;We are going to create a user, Choose the Installation Destination, Set the Network &amp;

&#xA0;</p><p>I started this project with a goal, use GitHub pages to host my ghost site. &#xA0;Github&apos;s webpage hosting is done through https://pages.github.io. &#xA0;GitHub Pages serves up static content from a GitHub project. &#xA0;GitHub has uses Jekyll a static site generator to create pages, but you do are not required to build pages in Jekyll. &#xA0;After building some sites in Jekyl over the years I have decided its just not for me. &#xA0;I like my wysiwyg page creation programs, and I want more theme options that do not involve building css from scratch or even a template starting point. &#xA0;</p><p>In comes Ghost a full featured CMS with a lot of fancy features. &#xA0;Ghost has one very nice trick, it is very simple to get started with. &#xA0;That learning curve is perfect for someone like me who hales from the land of Drupal, a system that is amazingly difficult to publish a simple webpage. </p><p>Ghost turns out to be a much better fit for my workflow. &#xA0;Building a site in ghost alllow me to create web pages and blog entries visually without needing to write markdown, then render and see what it looks like. &#xA0;Ghost creates good looking websites with very little design needed, or can be completely customized for an exact look and feel. &#xA0;How far you want to go with customization is completely up to you, there&apos;s no right or wrong approach! The majority of people use one of Ghost&apos;s built-in themes to get started, and then progress to something more bespoke later on as their site grows. &#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/brandsettings.png" class="kg-image" alt="Publishing a ghost site to github pages" loading="lazy" width="3456" height="2338"><figcaption>Ghost Admin &#x2192; Settings &#x2192; Branding</figcaption></figure><p>My ghost site is self hosted on a rocky linux server running (many rocky linux how to&apos;s are in my future) on my home proxmox server. &#xA0;The issue I ran into is there are a number of web pages and GitHub projects out there dedicated to the process of creating and static site uploading it to ghost pages, and they all have issues. &#xA0;Thre is some abandonware, instructions from 2013 and a myriad of other opinings on the process that just out of date. &#xA0;I was finally able to cobble together a working process that can be easily (sort of) replicated by others. &#xA0;</p><p>The process uses the ghost command shell to build this site, then get the Ghost Static Site Generator to generate a static folder, and finally Git / GitHub to push the entire mess to a repository. &#xA0;Github does the rest of the publishing. &#xA0;I burned through 3 separate scripts and full server installs in variouse processes that in the end did not work for me. &#xA0;Finally I built my own script to generate the static site and upload it to git hub. &#xA0;I am hooking this script up with cron to run every 6 hours. &#xA0;I do not post that often and with this setup I can create a new post remotely and it will eventually get posted to github. &#xA0;I tend to post on a weekly basis, 6 hours is just not going to hurt, and running that script to publish every hour or even more often is a waste of computing resources and power. &#xA0;Trust me here in Northern California the cost of power is a big issue.</p><p>With so much generously provided by other for me to use and get to this point, I have posted my script, and full instructions on the process on GitHub.</p><p>Enjoy the script!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/mjh2901/ghost-on-github">https://github.com/mjh2901/ghost-on-github</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[First Post to Ghost]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is the first post created in the Ghost CMS.
