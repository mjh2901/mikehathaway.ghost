The majority of people use one of Ghost&apos;s built-in themes to get started, and then progress to something more bespoke later on as their site grows. &#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/brandsettings.png" class="kg-image" alt="Publishing a ghost site to github pages" loading="lazy" width="3456" height="2338"><figcaption>Ghost Admin &#x2192; Settings &#x2192; Branding</figcaption></figure><p>My ghost site is self hosted on a rocky linux server running (many rocky linux how to&apos;s are in my future) on my home proxmox server. &#xA0;The issue I ran into is there are a number of web pages and GitHub projects out there dedicated to the process of creating and static site uploading it to ghost pages, and they all have issues. &#xA0;Thre is some abandonware, instructions from 2013 and a myriad of other opinings on the process that just out of date. &#xA0;I was finally able to cobble together a working process that can be easily (sort of) replicated by others. &#xA0;</p><p>The process uses the ghost command shell to build this site, then get the Ghost Static Site Generator to generate a static folder, and finally Git / GitHub to push the entire mess to a repository. &#xA0;Github does the rest of the publishing. &#xA0;I burned through 3 separate scripts and full server installs in variouse processes that in the end did not work for me. &#xA0;Finally I built my own script to generate the static site and upload it to git hub. &#xA0;I am hooking this script up with cron to run every 6 hours. &#xA0;I do not post that often and with this setup I can create a new post remotely and it will eventually get posted to github. &#xA0;I tend to post on a weekly basis, 6 hours is just not going to hurt, and running that script to publish every hour or even more often is a waste of computing resources and power. &#xA0;Trust me here in Northern California the cost of power is a big issue.</p><p>With so much generously provided by other for me to use and get to this point, I have posted my script, and full instructions on the process on GitHub.</p><p>Enjoy the script!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/mjh2901/ghost-on-github">https://github.com/mjh2901/ghost-on-github</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[First Post to Ghost]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is the first post created in the Ghost CMS.
